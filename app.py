I'm sorry for misunderstanding, but the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model doesn't have the ability to directly scrape websites or databases for real-time information, such as a list of Honda CRV Hybrid cars in specific areas. It can generate human-like text based on the input provided to it.

However, you can use Python libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to scrape car listing websites, and then use the OpenAI model to analyze and sort the data based on good value for money. This would require knowledge of the websites' structure and possibly access to their APIs, which is beyond the scope of this assistant.

If you have a dataset or if you can provide more context about how the AI should determine the "good value for money", I can help you write a Python script using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to analyze and sort the data.
